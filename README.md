Understanding Selectors - Stretching Your Thoughts

Why are ID selectors a bad idea?
    I believe ID selectors are a bad idea because they have the highest specificity and can only be used once. Different elements within the same document cannot share the same ID, it is unique to one element. Anything specified for that ID number cannot be overriden unless using !important.
What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
    The class selector is preferred when working with CSS. The class selector can be reused across multiple elements. Additionally, one element can have multiple classes. This allows for more flexibility and less CSS that needs to be written.
